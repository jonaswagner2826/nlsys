Nonlinear Dynamical System Modeling for MATLAB

Note: 2020-12-13 \\
This is a work in progress that is desigened to ultimently work as a
nonlinear equivelent to the control systems toolbox in MATLAB. This 
will eventually be able to encorporate the functionality of lti classes
from that toolbox and hopefully be integratable into simulink.

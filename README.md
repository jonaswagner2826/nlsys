Nonlinear Dynamical System Modeling for MATLAB

Note: 2020-12-13  
This is a work in progress that is desigened to ultimently work as a
nonlinear equivelent to the control systems toolbox in MATLAB. This 
will eventually be able to encorporate the functionality of lti classes
from that toolbox and hopefully be integratable into simulink.

This is now generally functional with integration with matlab lti blocks
and is able to represent composite structures of nonlinear systems
(including a rudementry feedback loop). Next up is simulation of them.
